http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2006.SG.Mueller.ProceduralModelingOfBuildings.final.pdf
A project that was done in graphic lab at university of Bonn in a team work.
The original paper added in main folder.
The language which was used is C++.
The project can be opened with Eclipse IDE.
It has 3 different parts:

1. Parser
2. Modelling
3. Visualizer

For running the code you need to install opengl library:

On linux do these:

From a terminal

1) sudo apt-get update

- This will update your apt database to the most recent available packages.

2) sudo apt-get install build-essential

- This installs the necessary development tools for building source code.

3) sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev

Then change your path to 'Debug' folder and run the following command:

4) ./Executable

The rules are defined in 'urbanmodel.zoo' file.

You can see sample output at main directory.
